COMPILING FROM SCRATCH
----------------------

To compile make for AmigaOS 4.1 please run the following commands:

Projects:make> sh
/projects/make> CFLAGS="-D_AMIGA -D__USE_INLINE__ -DUSE_OLD_ANCHORPATH" ./configure \
	--disable-posix-spawn --disable-load
/projects/make> make

It might still be possible to compile make with SAS/C for classic AmigaOS,
but this totally untested. Please see README.Amiga_OLD
